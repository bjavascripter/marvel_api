## Getting and displaying Data from the [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

This is my first attempt of handling data retrived from an API. :bowtie:

## Try this :poop: out! 

Type for example ***spider-man*** in the searchfield and press ***search*** then after a short while
some data should appear below the input area!

## If you do not know any marvel characters

Here are a couple of possibilities!

***venom***, ***punisher***, ***blade***, ***magneto***, ***hulk***, ***wolverine***.
